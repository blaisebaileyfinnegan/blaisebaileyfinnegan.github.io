<h2>Some background info on the music</h2>
</p>

<p>
When I discovered it months ago, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EC7OXaqO9s">background track</a>
was love at first sight. As an amateur, finding such a simple, cheesy, 12-bar blues was like heaven for me. It fulfilled my wildest dreams of overdone guitar noodling.
In a sense, it enabled the "playing just to play" mentality, which I'm sure plagues many other musicians.
With a personal intention of expanding this over the blog posts to come, let's talk about the overdubbed track and how my solo sounded.
</p>

<p>
First of all, this one felt great to play. Sweat rolling down the pits, my face melting off, sustaining crotch tears&mdash;the works.
I apprehensively listened to it. Here were my first impressions:
<ol>
<li>I suck</li>
<li>I'm not playing clean enough. Too many missed notes.</li>
<li>I suck</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Yep, that sounds like every other time I've had the pleasure of listening to myself play.
I gave it a couple more listens and over time thought it wasn't bad. There were certainly a lot of interesting ideas.
However, the pleasure in hearing my work certainly did not match up to the energy level I felt while playing the solo.
Why does the post-playing cringe factor correlate with playing pleasure?
</p>

<p>
Anyways, time to examine the content itself.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Some general thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Around the 1 minute mark, I doze in and out of into mechanical mode. I'm not phrasing any of my ideas.
As far as rhythm goes, I'm just letting it all out in a robotic and predictable fashion.
</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of a public speaker who doesn&#39;t give her/his audience time to digest ideas.
After speaking about big ideas, you normally give your audience time to react to what&#39;s happened by pausing.
You actually see it all the time in any form of communication, including writing.
</li></p>

<p><li>
It sounds clean enough. My ideas were ultimately expressed. Compare it to spelling errors. People still pick up on wat you&#39;re writing :)
</li></p>

<p><li>
I&#39;ve never really listened to myself play this much. I&#39;m actually hearing a good amount of John Mayer
in this. It&#39;s funny how when you listen to yourself improvise, you can pinpoint the origins of each lick/riff you&#39;re playing.
For each lick that passes by as I&#39;m listening, I&#39;m thinking:
<ul class="multi-level">
<li>
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s John Mayer in Who Did You Think I Was from 2007&quot;
</li>
<li>
&quot;That&#39;s a riff from Gravity by John Mayer 2007&quot;
</li>
<li>
&quot;Note-for-note, that&#39;s Albert King in Personal Manager off Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;
</li>
<li>
&quot;That sounds a bit like Covered in Rain by JM in 2002&quot;
</li>
</ul>
I have nothing against this. It&#39;s a lot of fun to play music that you love, and it&#39;s welcomingly shaping who I am.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Specific things</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1:38 - No idea where this came from, but I love it. A perspective on music sees it as a balance between dissonance and resolution. I&#39;m leaning more towards dissonance here.
</li>
<li>
2:30 - Oh god. I terribly messed up the climax. I remember blundering my way through this&mdash;I knew the general direction I was going and wanted to take a risk on a more dissonant high (major third).
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
However, I muted the money note due to poor technique. The vicinity after this climax, where I work my way down also seems very forced.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pleased with how this went, despite my initial cringe. I&#39;ve certainly come a long way since picking up guitar improvisation.
I haven&#39;t touched this track for a while, and just chose to do it without preparation since I&#39;m excited about starting this blog.
</p>
<h2>The next song</h2>
<h4>Slow Dancing in a Burning Room - John Mayer</h4>

<p>This is definitely out of my comfort zone. We&#39;ll see how this goes.</p></p>

<p>
For a first post, this feels like it was well self-contained despite expecting myself to be writing in tangents. I do hope I go off
on rants in the future about this site (I wrote it from scratch), musical improv, and opinionated ideas. I wouldn't be able to summarize
my goals with this blog just yet, but I feel that I will find them along the way.
</p>

<p>
There's a long road ahead for me and this website, and I hope you'll join us.
</p>

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
