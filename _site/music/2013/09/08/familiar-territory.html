<p style="margin-top: 1.5em">I&#39;m comfortable with the blues style of soloing. Without delving into theory too much, let me try to explain.
The blues allows for a diversity of note choices. It&#39;s <strong>meant</strong> to sound like something went wrong.
Therefore, the blues lexicon naturally allows far more freedom than other styles of play.
More often than not, playing the wrong thing <strong>still sounds bluesy</strong>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
However, when I move onto something like John Mayer&#39;s Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, I don&#39;t have that much liberty in making
wrong note choices. To make an analogy, it&#39;s like having to restrain your choice of words when at the dinnertable with your parents, 
as opposed to when you&#39;re with colleagues or friends. 
</p>
<p>
Actually--after reading this, I&#39;m going to cop out of my own argument. It&#39;s either that, or I haven&#39;t
explored other genres enough.
</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
I sharpened the tools in my shed. I practiced two different versions of the songs:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4opOKmtuxc" target="_blank">Off a live album called &quot;Where The Light Is&quot; 2007</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbJ5r-MPNBk" target="_blank">Live at Webster Hall 2006</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The process is simple, but takes time. Get it down word-for-word, and then apply it to your own improvisation.
Listening to my overdub should show how influenced it was by the existing material.
</p>
<p>
I improvised over the backing track a couple times, but to be honest--that never really helps too much. There&#39;s only so much gas
that any of us have at any given moment. If I chose to constantly hammer away at the backing track, I would only reinforce the <strong>same
ideas</strong> over and over.
</p>
<p>
When you improvise, you have to be as honest as possible, and channel as much of that honesty as you can to the outside, albeit with some guiding direction.
There&#39;s no point in trying to give more, when it&#39;s already been let out. Otherwise, you end up get stuck with the same idea, just with a little more volume.
If I wrote a comprehensive essay on how the sky is blue, there would be no point in trying to expand further after the conclusion. <strong>All of the relevant
ideas would have already been written.</strong>
<p></p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
<li>There's wankery sparsed about. Wankery would mean just playing while not contributing anything to the narrative of the solo.</li>
<li>I don't know how to play low energy level stuff. For an example, listen to the first minute and a half of the track. I
was trying to go for a build up of sort, but it ended up being an alternation between energy-releasing bends and warm sounding stuff.</li>
<li>While playing, I knew the direction I wanted to go, but I didn't know how to get there. The result would be the directionless
first minute.</li>
<li>1:25 - This is where I wanted to go. The problem is, I don't know how to properly transition from one area of the guitar neck to the other.
I had to just wing it. Here, I think it sounded fine since my guess of note choices paid off.</li>
<li>At 2:00, I wanted to conclude, but again I didn't know how to. I think it worked out.</li>
<li>I play the signature Slow Dancing riff at the end. After listening to it, it sounds really poorly played. More practice needed.</li>
<li>I was learning the outro solo of John Mayer's Gravity, and some of it sneaked in there.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A lot of different words and sentences added to my musical arsenal. I'm certainly pleased with the final product, despite general flaws/errors.
</p>

<h2>Next song</h2>

<h4>FIDLAR - No Waves</h4>

<p>This is by request from a good friend who is out of country. Actually, he might have been joking when he said it but fuck it dog, life's a risk.
<span style="font-size: 8px;">That stands for FIDLAR</span></p>

          I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Irvine studying computer science.
          I specialize in web development and shiny things.

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
