<p>About 4 months ago, I met a Korean tourist. After seeing him improvise on guitar, I was shocked at his command of the instrument--he made it sing with such intense emotion. After repairing my melted face, I asked him to be my mentor and he agreed.
</p><p>
I had always felt lost while practicing/playing guitar. I didn't know what to learn, I didn't know what to play. We jammed together for a while, but the best thing he ever did was set me in the right direction.
</p><p>
He taught me that music is a language not unlike English or Spanish. Any solo is comparable to an essay, and it is composed of paragraphs. Sentences, or guitar licks, make up those paragraphs and they communicate ideas. Sentences can be made up, or built using musical scales, or they can be stolen from idolized musicians. In the latter case, it's very similar to how you become better at writing as you read more literature.</p><p>I'm a believer in the 10,000 hour rule with maybe a few misgivings. The best thing you can do for yourself, is to find a language that you love learning. That language could be in writing, in mentoring, or even music. One that you have passion for, and one that satisfies your creative needs. Find the honest passion, and everything else will come through.
</p><p>
Because honestly, there's no such thing as talent--no one is born an english speaker in the same way that no one is born a singer. Language is learned. Anyone who is good at what they do got there by immersing themselves in it.
</p>

<h2>Do more with less</h2>
<p>This week, I decided that I would place a time constraint on the solo beforehand--30 seconds. For people who studied music a bit,
the 30 seconds derived from the 12 bar constraint.
</p><p>
Why? Because it forces me to concisely play with intent. Most of my solos have been lost. They wander around with no direction and with no idea
where home is. By clearly defining the start and end, I have a larger impetus to organize my ideas as they come. And I believe it shows in my rendition.
</p><p>
However, I wrestle with the idea that this goes against the spirit of musical improv. Placing time constraints naturally force you to take less risks,
which is counter-intuitive to the point of this whole blog. But on the other side, I could argue that the content is still being generated on the spot--I&#39;m still playing with feeling, and that musical channel is still coming out un-interfered.
</p><h2>How did I prepare?</h2>
<p>I learned the song including the riffs, which took about 5 minutes. Most punk music is very easy to play when you&#39;ve been learning John Mayer for so long, and this song was no different. I spent loads of time playing over the track itself, trying to find riffs that worked. In the end, I put them all together and made this.
</p><h2>Upon listening</h2>
<p>Personally, I think my solo sounded way too happy. Especially the ending of it. It doesn&#39;t agree with the whole punk vibe of the song. It doesn&#39;t inharmoniously clash against it, but it sounds like this solo should&#39;ve belonged to a different song.
</p><p>
One thing really sticks out to me--the high notes don&#39;t make sense past 0:25. Feels like I&#39;m listening to a Frankenstein of an improv.
</p><h2>Random notes</h2>
<p>As usual, some of my transitions between different riffs should be cleaned up.
</p><p>
After listening to 0:18, I had a huge opportunity to harmonize with the lead and take it in an awesome direction. If you listen to it, I sound like I&#39;m going in the same direction as the vocals, but it anticlimactically fizzles out as I go somewhere else. Poop. I missed out by not practicing the lead vocals on guitar, which I rarely do with songs. From now on, I&#39;m going to make that a habit.
</p><h2>Next song</h2><h3>Pink Floyd - Have a Cigar</h3>

          I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Irvine studying computer science.
          I specialize in web development and shiny things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work on a campus-wide
          system for <a href="http://eee.uci.edu" target="_blank">EEE @ UCI</a>.

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
