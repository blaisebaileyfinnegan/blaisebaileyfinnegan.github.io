<h2>Pink Floyd - Have a Cigar</h2>

<p>Damnit. This is one of those times where I just didn&#39;t feel like playing, but duly obliged because of my promise to post a sound every week. Again, nothing special about preparation for the song. Learn the whole song, learn the main solo, play over it a few times, and then make your track. This time was different.  </p>

<p>My jam is marked by a forceful expulsion of amateurish playing in the first 45 seconds. In my opinion, that just ruined whatever I had going for the rest of the track. And that&#39;s not saying much for everything else. Sure, the whole track itself isn&#39;t that bad--only if you can bear to to listen past the string noises that kick off my shitshow. But in my opinion, I didn&#39;t put any soul in it. This is one of those times where I felt like playing out of pure obligation. There was no emotion involved. There were no visceral feelings involved in the making of this track.  </p>

<p>I cannot get past the lack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato">vibrato</a>, which makes it sound very boring to me. And those damn out-of-tune bends. I don&#39;t want to point them out. If you don&#39;t know where they are, just think about those moments when you cringed. That&#39;s exactly where they are.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s not much to analyze here. This one will be shoved back through the annals of times, where no one except history&#39;s worst villains can listen to it.  </p>

<p>On a lighter note, I&#39;m looking forward to the next song. </p>

<h2>Next song</h2>

<p>By unpopular request, I picked this song next. Now, onto greener pastures.  </p>

<p>Michael</p>

          I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Irvine studying computer science.
          I specialize in web development and shiny things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work on a campus-wide
          system for <a href="http://eee.uci.edu" target="_blank">EEE @ UCI</a>.

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
