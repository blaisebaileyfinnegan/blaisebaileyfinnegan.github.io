<p>Very short improv this week--I limited myself to a small section of the song. I think constraining myself time-wise was a good decision.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually in one of those phases where I just feel like crap about my own playing. It&#39;s actually a vicious cycle with maybe a monthly basis. You feel genuinely good about your playing for a month, and then suddenly you wake up and you&#39;re a completely bad guitar player. It never seems to be anywhere in the middle.  </p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>I went through the same routine where I learn the song and played over it a few times. Honestly, the song wasn&#39;t my taste so I didn&#39;t have much going for it in terms of investment. Interestingly, I devoted most of my time this week to learn other songs besides Offend In Every Way.  </p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>This one felt good to play, even though I wasn&#39;t invested in the song itself. However, nothing about my improvisation really speaks to me. There are some licks that I definitely play too much, like the one at 0:12. That simple run is at the top of my bag of tricks and I&#39;ve beaten it to death.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a distinct lack of vibrato in this one. I&#39;m currently making an effort to practice that, so it&#39;ll hopefully show up within the next few weeks.</p>

<h2>Next song</h2>

          I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Irvine studying computer science.
          I specialize in web development and shiny things.

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
