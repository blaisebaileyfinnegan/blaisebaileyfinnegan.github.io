<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I think writing for the sake of writing is difficult. For me, it&#39;s not about how to convey ideas. In fact, it feels very liberating
to get something down on paper that&#39;s been brewing inside of my head. The problem, or the most aggravating thing is always choosing what to write about.  </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ve got a whole list of opinions or ideas going on inside my head, but none of them have matured enough for me to talk about them without looking like a ranting lunatic. Even worse, sometimes I think of something great and start typing with the biggest shit-eating grin, only to read it right after and shake my head in embarrassment.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a struggle. I want it to be easy, but sadly there&#39;s no better alternative then just working through it. What&#39;s to blame? I certainly don&#39;t have writer&#39;s block. The only time I will ever be able to say that, is when I can effortlessly describe ideas onto paper. Because when you&#39;re in your 20s, you&#39;re honestly not going to be very good at anything.  </p>

<h2>Improv</h2>

<p>Anyways, let&#39;s talk about the improv. I genuinely liked this one, more so than the previous weeks. I played slower than usual to focus on the melody, and that resulted in less
mistakes. For practice, I actually learned John Mayer&#39;s cover of the song which has a terrific solo. Of course, I went ahead and stole some ideas from it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m really enjoying playing guitar these days. It used to be that I had to learn as much as possible, since I sucked. It&#39;s different now. I still suck, but
I&#39;ve been playing based on more basic animalistic thoughts starting with phrases like &quot;Ooh, that sounds cool!&quot; or &quot;I wonder if I can...&quot;

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>Gee, I don&#39;t really know. Therefore, I&#39;ll just pick this.<br>

          I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Irvine studying computer science.
          I specialize in web development and shiny things.

          I currently work on a campus-wide

          I'm an avid blues guitar player. My favorite guitar player is John Mayer,
          especially when he was still active with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkO3SGB3So" target="_blank">Trio</a>.
          I work on weekly guitar improvisations which may or may
          not suck.
