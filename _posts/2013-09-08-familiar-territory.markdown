<h3 class="no-top-margin">Here's a recording of me playing over Slow Dancing in a Burning Room by John Mayer</h3>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em">I'm comfortable with the blues style of soloing. Without delving into theory too much, let me try to explain.
The blues allows for a diversity of note choices. It's <strong>meant</strong> to sound like something went wrong.
Therefore, the blues lexicon naturally allows far more freedom than other styles of play.
More often than not, playing the wrong thing <strong>still sounds bluesy</strong>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
However, when I move onto something like John Mayer's Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, I don't have that much liberty in making
wrong note choices. To make an analogy, it's like having to restrain your choice of words when at the dinnertable with your parents, 
as opposed to when you're with colleagues or friends. 
</p>
<p>
Actually--after reading this, I'm going to cop out of my own argument. It's either that, or I haven't
explored other genres enough.
</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>
I sharpened the tools in my shed. I practiced two different versions of the songs:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4opOKmtuxc" target="_blank">Off a live album called "Where The Light Is" 2007</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbJ5r-MPNBk" target="_blank">Live at Webster Hall 2006</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The process is simple, but takes time. Get it down word-for-word, and then apply it to your own improvisation.
Listening to my overdub should show how influenced it was by the existing material.
</p>
<p>
I improvised over the backing track a couple times, but to be honest--that never really helps too much. There's only so much gas
that any of us have at any given moment. If I chose to constantly hammer away at the backing track, I would only reinforce the <strong>same
ideas</strong> over and over.
</p>
<p>
When you improvise, you have to be as honest as possible, and channel as much of that honesty as you can to the outside, albeit with some guiding direction.
There's no point in trying to give more, when it's already been let out. Otherwise, you end up get stuck with the same idea, just with a little more volume.
If I wrote a comprehensive essay on how the sky is blue, there would be no point in trying to expand further after the conclusion. <strong>All of the relevant
ideas would have already been written.</strong>
<p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>There's wankery sparsed about. Wankery would mean just playing while not contributing anything to the narrative of the solo.</li>
<li>I don't know how to play low energy level stuff. For an example, listen to the first minute and a half of the track. I
was trying to go for a build up of sort, but it ended up being an alternation between energy-releasing bends and warm sounding stuff.</li>
<li>While playing, I knew the direction I wanted to go, but I didn't know how to get there. The result would be the directionless
first minute.</li>
<li>1:25 - This is where I wanted to go. The problem is, I don't know how to properly transition from one area of the guitar neck to the other.
I had to just wing it. Here, I think it sounded fine since my guess of note choices paid off.</li>
<li>At 2:00, I wanted to conclude, but again I didn't know how to. I think it worked out.</li>
<li>I play the signature Slow Dancing riff at the end. After listening to it, it sounds really poorly played. More practice needed.</li>
<li>I was learning the outro solo of John Mayer's Gravity, and some of it sneaked in there.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot of different words and sentences added to my musical arsenal. I'm certainly pleased with the final product, despite general flaws/errors.

<p>This is by request from a good friend who is out of country. Actually, he might have been joking when he said it but fuck it dog, life's a risk.
<span style="font-size: 8px;">That stands for FIDLAR</span></p>
