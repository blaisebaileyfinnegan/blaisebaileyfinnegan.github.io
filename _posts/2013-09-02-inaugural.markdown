<h2>Some background info on the music</h2>
</p>
<p>
When I discovered it months ago, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EC7OXaqO9s">background track</a>
was love at first sight. As an amateur, finding such a simple, cheesy, 12-bar blues was like heaven for me. It fulfilled my wildest dreams of overdone guitar noodling.
In a sense, it enabled the "playing just to play" mentality, which I'm sure plagues many other musicians.
With a personal intention of expanding this over the blog posts to come, let's talk about the overdubbed track and how my solo sounded.
</p>

<p>
First of all, this one felt great to play. Sweat rolling down the pits, my face melting off, sustaining crotch tears&mdash;the works.
I apprehensively listened to it. Here were my first impressions:
<ol>
<li>I suck</li>
<li>I'm not playing clean enough. Too many missed notes.</li>
<li>I suck</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Yep, that sounds like every other time I've had the pleasure of listening to myself play.
I gave it a couple more listens and over time thought it wasn't bad. There were certainly a lot of interesting ideas.
However, the pleasure in hearing my work certainly did not match up to the energy level I felt while playing the solo.
Why does the post-playing cringe factor correlate with playing pleasure?
</p>
<p>
Anyways, time to examine the content itself.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Some general thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Around the 1 minute mark, I doze in and out of into mechanical mode. I'm not phrasing any of my ideas.
As far as rhythm goes, I'm just letting it all out in a robotic and predictable fashion.
</p>
This is the equivalent of a public speaker who doesn't give her/his audience time to digest ideas.
After speaking about big ideas, you normally give your audience time to react to what's happened by pausing.
You actually see it all the time in any form of communication, including writing.
</li>

<li>
It sounds clean enough. My ideas were ultimately expressed. Compare it to spelling errors. People still pick up on wat you're writing :)
</li>

<li>
I've never really listened to myself play this much. I'm actually hearing a good amount of John Mayer
in this. It's funny how when you listen to yourself improvise, you can pinpoint the origins of each lick/riff you're playing.
For each lick that passes by as I'm listening, I'm thinking:
<ul class="multi-level">
<li>
"Yeah, that's John Mayer in Who Did You Think I Was from 2007"
</li>
<li>
"That's a riff from Gravity by John Mayer 2007"
</li>
<li>
"Note-for-note, that's Albert King in Personal Manager off Born Under a Bad Sign"
</li>
<li>
"That sounds a bit like Covered in Rain by JM in 2002"
</li>
</ul>
I have nothing against this. It's a lot of fun to play music that you love, and it's welcomingly shaping who I am.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Specific things</h2>
<ul>
<li>
1:38 - No idea where this came from, but I love it. A perspective on music sees it as a balance between dissonance and resolution. I'm leaning more towards dissonance here.
</li>
<li>
2:30 - Oh god. I terribly messed up the climax. I remember blundering my way through this&mdash;I knew the general direction I was going and wanted to take a risk on a more dissonant high (major third).
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
However, I muted the money note due to poor technique. The vicinity after this climax, where I work my way down also seems very forced.
</p>
<p>
I'm pleased with how this went, despite my initial cringe. I've certainly come a long way since picking up guitar improvisation.
I haven't touched this track for a while, and just chose to do it without preparation since I'm excited about starting this blog.
</p>
<h2>The next song</h2>
<h4>Slow Dancing in a Burning Room - John Mayer</h4>

<p>This is definitely out of my comfort zone. We'll see how this goes.</p>

<p>
For a first post, this feels like it was well self-contained despite expecting myself to be writing in tangents. I do hope I go off
on rants in the future about this site (I wrote it from scratch), musical improv, and opinionated ideas. I wouldn't be able to summarize
my goals with this blog just yet, but I feel that I will find them along the way.
</p>
<p>
There's a long road ahead for me and this website, and I hope you'll join us.
</p>

Michael
