I re-designed my website. My old site's objective was to
showcase the guitar improvisations that I regularly worked on. I ultimately wanted to become
a better guitarist from it.

That's cool and all, but I also discovered that I also enjoy writing about things.
Not only that, but I also liked to build things so I thought--why not write my own [blogging software](https://github.com/blaisebaileyfinnegan/sharpfret)?

So I started building one. And sure enough, it worked out to an extent when I wanted to publish content. But then I noticed that
there was too much obstruction to writing. I had to actually **create** all the HTML from scratch whenever
I posted a new improv. So then, I went to work making it easier by using a [Markdown parser](https://github.com/chjj/marked). Cool! But then I wanted to **delete** posts. I was painstakingly (and dangerously) interacting with the
website's database just to delete stuff. And if I wanted to edit posts? Oh boy, I had to code something for that too!

See where I'm going with this? By the end of the day, it was defeating the original purpose of my website. I wanted to spend time creating content, not maintaining the tool needed to present it. More specifically, I was re-inventing the wheel and growing tired of it.

![How I felt](/old/img/scream-externally.png)

Imagine you need some city transportation, so you decide to build a car.

You put together an engine, a couple of wooden planks, and four wheels. You apply copious amounts of effort into putting it all together. You combine centuries of scientific and engineering techniques/principles to produce your own magnum opus in a month. You'd feel fucking awesome right?

Well, you would for a bit. Then summer comes around and you don't have A/C. Your steering wheel falls off because it turns out Scotch tape isn't good for building cars. People start laughing at you because your car looks like a piece of crap.

You've actually decided to eschew modern, well-established automobile makers, which likely faced the same problems you did while building your own car. You essentially re-create hundreds of thousands of hours of work to build something which is inarguably shitty and difficult to use.

Well, that's kind of how I felt working on my own blog. But it's not all for naught.

There's some merit to it. If you're an engineer, you should always know how something works under the hood before you start using it. Arguably, I learned a **lot** about web development and coding non-negligible sized systems while working on it. I got experience with a different technologies, one of them being [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

But ultimately, I learned:

<del>Don't re-invent the wheel.</del>
### **Re-invent the wheel. It's worth it.**

If you have a problem, it's likely been solved before--but that doesn't mean that it's a waste of time to tackle it from scratch. Of course, this statement depends on the size of the wheel, and on how important the wheel is, along with other factors I am naive about. Your mileage may vary.

So, here's my new website/blog hosted on GitHub pages, with content written by me and generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a very powerful wheel, especially for coders. If you're tech savvy and are thinking of running a blog, you should definitely research it.
