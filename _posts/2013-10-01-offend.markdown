Very short improv this week--I limited myself to a small section of the song. I think constraining myself time-wise was a good decision.

I'm actually in one of those phases where I just feel like crap about my own playing. It's actually a vicious cycle with maybe a monthly basis. You feel genuinely good about your playing for a month, and then suddenly you wake up and you're a completely bad guitar player. It never seems to be anywhere in the middle.  

## Practice  
I went through the same routine where I learn the song and played over it a few times. Honestly, the song wasn't my taste so I didn't have much going for it in terms of investment. Interestingly, I devoted most of my time this week to learn other songs besides Offend In Every Way.  

## Thoughts  
This one felt good to play, even though I wasn't invested in the song itself. However, nothing about my improvisation really speaks to me. There are some licks that I definitely play too much, like the one at 0:12. That simple run is at the top of my bag of tricks and I've beaten it to death.  

There's also a distinct lack of vibrato in this one. I'm currently making an effort to practice that, so it'll hopefully show up within the next few weeks.
