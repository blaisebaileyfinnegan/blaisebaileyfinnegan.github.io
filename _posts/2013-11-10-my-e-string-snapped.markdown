## Some random blues track
Sorry about the silence--I've been awfully busy! Here's another entry in the books.

My guitar's high E string snapped at the end of this. It's usually a nuisance whenever that happens because I need to re-string the guitar again, but it felt especially good since this improv was full of emotion. I don't want to write this time--I will re-visit this post in the near future, but I felt like posting something today.
